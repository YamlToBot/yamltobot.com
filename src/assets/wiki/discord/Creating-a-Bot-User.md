## Creating a Bot User

To get started with YamlToBot for Discord, you must first create a bot user. Let's Get Started

### Step 1

Navigate to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and click on "Create an application"

### Step 2

Give your application a name, description, and icon. All of these options can be changed later, however it is recommended to set at least the name now.

Then, click the "Save changes" button at the bottom of the page.

### Step 3

After you have saved your changes, navigate to the "Bot" tab in the lefthand column. Click on the "Add Bot" button

### Step 4

After you have saved your changes, under "Token", click "Reveal Token" to get your bot token. Keep this information to yourself, as you'll have to generate a new one if it gets into the wrong hands! We'll use this value for later in the config as the value for "token".
